# encvim
Command line tool to edit an encrypted file with automatic pre-decryption and
re-encryption.

# Dependencies
vim, openssl, md5, perl

# TODO
 - Maybe rewrite in bash.
 - Maybe abstractify the editor to allow the user to choose the preferred one
   (but then the name would have to be changed)
